///  Light deflection by a single solar−system body
/// 
///  Apply light deflection by a solar-system body, as part of
///  transforming coordinate direction into natural direction.
///
///  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
///  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
///
///  Status:  support function.
///
///  Given:
///  ```
///     bm     double     mass of the gravitating body (solar masses)
///     p      double[3]  direction from observer to source (unit vector)
///     q      double[3]  direction from body to source (unit vector)
///     e      double[3]  direction from body to observer (unit vector)
///     em     double     distance from body to observer (au)
///     dlim   double     deflection limiter (Note 4)
///  ```
///  Returned:
///  ```
///     p1     double[3]  observer to deflected source (unit vector)
///  ```
///  Notes:
///
///  1) The algorithm is based on Expr. (70) in Klioner (2003) and
///     Expr. (7.63) in the Explanatory Supplement (Urban & Seidelmann
///     2013), with some rearrangement to minimize the effects of machine
///     precision.
///
///  2) The mass parameter bm can, as required, be adjusted in order to
///     allow for such effects as quadrupole field.
///
///  3) The barycentric position of the deflecting body should ideally
///     correspond to the time of closest approach of the light ray to
///     the body.
///
///  4) The deflection limiter parameter dlim is phi^2/2, where phi is
///     the angular separation (in radians) between source and body at
///     which limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen
///     threshold, the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero
///     for phi = 0.
///
///  5) The returned vector p1 is not normalized, but the consequential
///     departure from unit magnitude is always negligible.
///
///  6) The arguments p and p1 can be the same array.
///
///  7) To accumulate total light deflection taking into account the
///     contributions from several bodies, call the present function for
///     each body in succession, in decreasing order of distance from the
///     observer.
///
///  8) For efficiency, validation is omitted.  The supplied vectors must
///     be of unit magnitude, and the deflection limiter non-zero and
///     positive.
